# ascii-canvas.js

*Very early in development!*

This is a javascript framework for drawing monospace ascii on a canvas. In the future functionality for game development is planned.

### Features:
- Draw single characters on grid
- Draw boxes of characters on grid
- Draw horizontal and vertical strings on grid
- Draw from file (e.g. .txt) source

All functionality is contained in ascii-canvas.js and pretty self explanatory
